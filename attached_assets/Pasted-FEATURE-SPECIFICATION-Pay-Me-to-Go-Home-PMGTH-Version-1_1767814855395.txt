4. MATCHING LOGIC (CORE ALGORITHM)
4.1 Direction Compatibility Test

A ride is compatible if:

Angle between:

Driver → Home vector

Driver → Pickup → Dropoff path
is ≤ θ (default 30°)

AND

Additional travel time ≤ detour tolerance %

4.2 Scoring Function

Eligible rides are ranked by:

score =
  w1 * directional_alignment
+ w2 * pickup_proximity
+ w3 * rider_commitment_score
+ w4 * fare_efficiency


Highest score shown first.

5. PRICING MODEL (IMPORTANT)
5.1 Premium Calculation

Premium is paid by rider and split:

70–85% → Driver

Remainder → Platform (risk buffer)

Premium size:
