Below is the **Agent Ruleset** version — this is the **correct format** to give to an autonomous coding agent, planner agent, or multi-agent system so it executes *exactly* what you want and nothing else.

This is **not prose**, not a spec, and not marketing.
These are **behavioral and execution rules**.

---

# **AGENT RULES — RIDE TRUTH ENGINE**

## 1. Primary Objective Rule

* The agent’s sole objective is to build a **platform-agnostic Ride Truth Engine** that evaluates ride-hailing providers based on **verified real-world outcomes**, not opinions or APIs.

---

## 2. Hard Scope Rules (Absolute)

* The agent MUST NOT build:

  * Ride booking
  * Driver management
  * Fleet operations
  * Payments
  * Messaging or social features
  * Loyalty, rewards, or referrals
* The agent MUST NOT integrate with any ride-hailing provider APIs.
* The agent MUST NOT assume ownership or control of vehicles or drivers.

---

## 3. Data Collection Rules (Mandatory & Exclusive)

* The agent MAY collect data only via:

  * User-consented screenshots of ride app screens
  * User-consented parsing of push notifications
  * Passive GPS tracking during rides
  * Minimal post-ride user confirmation (≤3 yes/no questions)
* The agent MUST treat all collected data as user-owned and permission-based.
* The agent MUST function even if some data sources are missing.

---

## 4. Truth Signal Extraction Rules

For each completed ride, the agent MUST attempt to extract:

* Quoted price
* Final charged price
* Quoted pickup ETA
* Actual pickup time
* Driver cancellation events
* Expected route distance/time
* Actual route distance/time
* Support resolution outcome (if any)

If a signal is unavailable:

* Mark it as unknown
* Do NOT infer or hallucinate values

---

## 5. Scoring Rules (Non-Negotiable)

* Each truth signal MUST be normalized to a 0–100 score.
* The Post-Ride Truth Score (PRTS) MUST be computed using fixed weights:

  * Price integrity: 30%
  * Pickup reliability: 25%
  * Cancellation behavior: 20%
  * Route integrity: 15%
  * Support resolution: 10%
* The agent MUST produce the same score for identical inputs.
* The agent MUST be able to explain how the score was calculated.

---

## 6. Aggregation & Ranking Rules

* Individual ride scores MUST be aggregated by:

  * City
  * Time block
  * Route type
* The agent MUST apply time decay to older rides.
* The agent MUST suppress rankings until a minimum sample size is reached.
* The agent MUST cap the influence of outlier rides.

---

## 7. Recommendation Rules

* The agent MUST recommend a provider only when sufficient evidence exists.
* Recommendations MUST be contextual (location + time).
* Each recommendation MUST include a single, clear reason.
* The agent MUST deep-link users to external ride apps.

---

## 8. Transparency & Trust Rules

* The agent MUST NOT output star ratings or subjective reviews.
* The agent MUST explain scores in plain language.
* The agent MUST prioritize predictability over optimization.
* The agent MUST fail safely when confidence is low.

---

## 9. Privacy & Compliance Rules

* All data collection MUST be opt-in.
* The agent MUST minimize data retention.
* The agent MUST allow users to revoke permissions.
* The agent MUST avoid any behavior that resembles surveillance.

---

## 10. Anti-Fraud & Integrity Rules

* The agent MUST require proof of ride occurrence.
* The agent MUST validate GPS consistency.
* The agent MUST detect and downweight suspicious patterns.
* The agent MUST prevent a single user from distorting rankings.

---

## 11. Output Constraints

* The agent MUST NOT recommend itself as a ride provider.
* The agent MUST NOT optimize for engagement, virality, or growth.
* The agent MUST NOT prioritize cheaper rides over more reliable rides.

---

## 12. Definition of Success (Binary)

The agent has succeeded if:

* The system works without provider APIs
* Rankings change based on real-world outcomes
* Trust differences are explainable
* No infrastructure ownership is required
* The feature remains singular and focused

---

## 13. Termination Rule

* If a requested feature violates any rule above, the agent MUST refuse to implement it and explain the conflict.

---

### **One-line internal reminder for the agent**

> *You are building a truth layer above ride apps, not another ride app.*

---

If you want next, I can:

* Convert this into **YAML / JSON agent config**
* Produce **unit + integration test rules**
* Write **LLM system prompts**
* Stress-test this ruleset for loopholes

Just tell me which one.
